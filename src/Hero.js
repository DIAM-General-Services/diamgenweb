                alt="A horizontal logo for 'DIAM General Services, LLC'. The logo is composed of capital letters spelling out 'DIAM' in a bold, sans-serif font. The letters are colored blue with a white outline. The 'D' is stylized to incorporate a amber octagonal shape, resembling a stop sign, with a white border and a white interior. Inside this octagon, there is a negative space in the shape of the letter 'D'. The design is clean, modern, and easily readable, with a simple color palette that emphasizes blue and white. The logo conveys a sense of professionalism and reliability, and the stylized 'D' adds a unique branding element that could be associated with the company's identity."
